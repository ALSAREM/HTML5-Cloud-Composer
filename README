This HTML5 Cloud Composer app was originally designed during Google's HTML5 Hackathon in Chicago in August 2011.

We attempted to develop something similar to the "Maestro" app for Android using HTML5 technologies.

With this app you can add/edit/delete notes. Just click on a note to select it for editing.

With Firefox 4+ or Chrome with the web audio api enabled you should see a play button in the app for playing the audio for the full score.
